Project Structure Explanation
data/: Contains all raw and processed data.
logs/: Logs and TensorBoard files for monitoring and evaluation.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prototyping.
reports/: Final reports generated after data analysis.
results/: Results from experiments, including models and outputs.
src/: Contains all source code related to data ingestion, preprocessing, modeling, and interpretability.
Running the Project
Prepare the data by placing your raw files in the data/processed/raw/ directory.
Preprocess the data using the provided scripts in the src/preprocessing/ directory.
Train models using scripts in src/modeling/, and evaluate them using the src/interpretability/ scripts.
Review logs and results under the logs/ and results/ directories, respectively.
